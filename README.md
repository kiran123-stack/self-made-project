‚ú® leena cosmetic An small animated website with lots of efforts
![Placeholder for an animated GIF showcasing the website's main scroll or interactive animation]

üåü Overview
Welcome to Stellar Studio, a high-fidelity, fully animated landing page designed to serve as a modern digital portfolio. This project is a demonstration of advanced front-end animation techniques using GSAP (GreenSock) for scroll-triggered events and complex SVG morphing. It provides a highly immersive and dynamic user experience, far beyond a typical static website.

‚ú® Key Features
Cinematic Scroll-Based Animations: Content is revealed and transformed as the user scrolls, creating a narrative flow.

Interactive 3D/Canvas Elements: Includes a lightweight, interactive canvas background or 3D scene (e.g., using Three.js or a library like particles.js).

Performance-Optimized: Despite the heavy animation, the site maintains a smooth 60 FPS experience on most modern devices.

Fully Responsive & Accessible: Built with a mobile-first approach ensuring animations scale gracefully across all screen sizes.

Modular Component Structure: Easy to update and extend thanks to its clean structure built with React components.
